    For example on LaTeX underline: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/630161288538095626/790550034688901140/unknown.png
    Dirty fix: `* { --content: #bbbbbb !important }`
  ☐ Make a more ergonomic figure shortcode
    ☐ With simple centering
  ☐ Make margin shortcode
    Because adding them in Markdown is a pain
  ☐ Put this on nufflee.com, somehow
  ☐ Use new center align method instead of my custom shortcode
    https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/commit/a36d0452145c32ef41e7b9d83246dc6327fdfd01
  ☐ Googl Anal ticks? Maybe?

      https://termly.io/resources/articles/google-analytics-privacy-policy/

    Shortcodes aren't formatted very well in them: http://localhost:1313/blog/posts/buidl/#advent-of-code-day-12----rain-risk-hahahugoshortcode-s3-hbhb
    Doesn't seem like there's a good way to do this...
  ☐ How to embed Twitch/BTTV/FFZ emotes like regular emojis
    Didn't have time and this is probably of very low value.
  ☐ Move inline styles out of `warning.html`
